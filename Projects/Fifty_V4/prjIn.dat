This program will simulate the dice game Fifty which requires 2 players with each player taking turns to roll 2 die. The goal of Fifty is to be the first player to reach 50 points. You get points by rolling doubles. All doubles except 3s and 6s score 5 points. Double 6s are worth 25 points and double 3s wipe out the players entire score and the player must start again at 0. Non-double rolls are 0 points.
